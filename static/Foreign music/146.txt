Typical
Hardly the type I fall for
I like when the physical
Don't leave me asking for more

Just how to get what I wanna wanna
I want to do is spring this on you on you
Back up all of the things that I told you told you
Told you told you
You've been saying all the right things all night long
But I can't seem to get you over here to help take this off

You say you're a big boy
But I can't agree
'Cause my love you said you had
Ain't been put on me
I wonder wonder
I'm just too much for you
Wonder wonder
My kiss don't make you just
Wonder wonder

What you want to do do
Take a chance to recognize that this could be yours
