Paralyse

Let me know if we're on
Let me know if we're off
Let me know
Let me know
I'm sitting here in the middle of the road
With my clothes on my back wondering where I'm gonna go
Thrown to the ground not a lover but a girl
Looking back at the days when I didn't know the world
I've been thrown by the wayside
Got dragged out by the riptide
Take me back to the daylight
I know now what it is to
Sink so low that you can't move
I've been paralysed by you
I've been paralysed by you
Let me know what to do
Is it all gone for you
Let me know
Let me know
Let me know what to do
Is it all gone for you
Let me know
Let me know
I'm sitting here I got nothing but my name
Got a bag full of ash and a pocket full of shame
Head to the floor send a wish up to the sky but
I'm waking up to nothing and I have to wonder why
I've been thrown by the wayside
Got dragged out by the riptide
Take me back to the daylight
I know now what it is to
Sink so low that you can't move
I've been paralysed by you
I've been paralysed by you
I've been thrown by the wayside
Got dragged out by the riptide
Take me back to the daylight
I know now what it is to
Sink so low that you can't move
I've been paralysed by you
I've been paralysed by you
I've been thrown by the wayside
Got dragged out by the riptide
Take me back to the daylight
I know now what it is to
Sink so low that you can't move
I've been paralysed by you
I've been paralysed by you
