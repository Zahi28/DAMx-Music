Rain

I Wish EP

I spend each day
Thinking what else can I do 
To make you stay
Fix what's broken within you
But it feels like it already ended
I'm just praying that youll try to mend it
I hope that youll change your mind
I told you that I needed space
But that was not the case
I don't know what to do
You tell me that I've changed
But I've stayed the same and
Somethings wrong with you
And I can't take
The fighting every night
I can't take
The tears I know you cry
Why can't we go back
Baby' go back in time
When it rains oh it pours
And it tears your heart right open
Somethings changed thats for sure
And I know your spirits broken
But don't let go
What we got can withstand
A little lightning
Baby I don't know just what its gonna take
But were gonna stop this rain
Hoping' wishing
Praying for something to change
Our love back then
Seems so long ago today
But I'm not one to give up so easy
Theres nothing that I wouldn't do to see
Us back to the way that we were
I told you that I needed space
But that was not the case
I don't know what to do
You tell me that I've changed
But I've stayed the same and
Somethings wrong with you
And I can't take
The fighting every night
I can't take
The tears I know you cry
Why can't we go back
Baby' go back in time
When it rains oh it pours
And it tears your heart right open
Somethings changed thats for sure
And I know your spirits broken
But don't let go
What we got can withstand
A little lightning
Baby I don't know just what its gonna take
But were gonna stop this rain
Oh' when the rain falls
You run for cover
And all I do is wonder
If youll come back
Get this on track
When the clouds part
Will love still be in your heart
Or will you be drowning
In all your pain
We will stop the rain
When it rains oh it pours
And it tears your heart right open
Somethings changed thats for sure
And I know your spirits broken
But don't let go
What we got can withstand
A little lightning
Baby I don't know just what its gonna take
But were gonna stop this rain
