We Are Never Ever Getting Back Together
Taylor Swift
We Are Never Ever Getting Back Together

I remember when we broke up the first time
Saying This is it I've had enough 'cause like
We hadn't seen each other in a month
When you said you needed space what 
Then you come around again and say
Baby I miss you and I swear
I'm gonna change trust me
Remember how that lasted for a day 
I say I hate you we break up 
You call me I love you 
Ooh we called it off again last night
But ooh this time I'm telling you 
I'm telling you
We are never ever ever
Getting back together 
We are never ever ever
Getting back together 
You go talk to your friends 
Talk to my friends talk to me
But we are never ever ever ever
Getting back together
Like ever  
I'm really gonna miss you picking fights
And me falling for it screaming that I'm right
And you would hide away
And find your peace of mind
With some indie record
That's much cooler than mine
Ooh you called me up again tonight
But ooh this time I'm telling you 
I'm telling you
We are never ever ever
Getting back together
We are never ever ever
Getting back together
You go talk to your friends 
Talk to my friends talk to me
Talk to me
But we are never ever ever ever
Getting back together
Ooh yeah ooh yeah ooh yeah
Oh oh oh
I used to think that we were forever ever
And I used to say Never say never 
Uggg  so he calls me up and he's like 
I still love you 
And I'm like  I just  I mean this is exhausting 
You know like 
We are never getting back together 
Like ever
No 
We are never ever ever
Getting back together
We are never ever ever
Getting back together
You go talk to your friends 
Talk to my friends talk to me
But we are never ever ever ever
Getting back together
We ooh getting back together 
We ooh getting back together
You go talk to your friends 
Talk to my friends 
Talk to me talk to me
But we are never ever ever ever
Getting back together
