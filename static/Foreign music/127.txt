Burn Out

Flash far I'm coming for ya
You're gonna fill me like the summer like the sun in your eyes
Hold tight another minute
Another hour baby I'mma show you
You can rely on me
I'll give you all you need
In a small cloud tryna find ground
In a place where we belong
We don't have to dream to make it beautiful
Baby everything we do is beautiful
We can light a fire watch it everglow
We won't burn out we won't burn out
We won't burn out we won't burn out
We won't burn out we won't burn out
Won't take a million dollars
For us to have a kind of love you only see in a dream
Wake up 'cause now you're in it
I wanna show you all the magic in the air
And tonight is free
It will be all you need
In a small cloud tryna find ground
In a place where we belong
We don't have to dream to make it beautiful
Baby everything we do is beautiful
We can light a fire watch it everglow
We won't burn out we won't burn out
We won't burn out we won't burn out
We won't burn out we won't burn out
We won't burn out we won't burn out
