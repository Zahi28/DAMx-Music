I Do - Single

My whole world changed from the moment I met you
And it would never be the same
Felt like I knew that I'd always love you
From the moment I heard your name
Everything was perfect I knew this love is worth it
Our own miracle in the makin'
'Til the world stops turning
I'll still be here waiting and waiting to make that vow that I'll
I'll be by your side 'til the day I die
I'll be waiting 'til hear you say I do
Something old something new
Something borrowed something blue
I'll be waiting 'til I hear you say I do
Smiles by the thousands ya tears have all dried out
'Cos I won't see you cry again
Throw pennies in the fountain and look at what comes out
Sometimes wishes do come true
Everything was perfect I knew this love is worth it
Our own miracle in the makin'
'Til the world stops turning
I'll still be here waiting and waiting to make that vow that I'll
I'll be by your side 'til the day I die
I'll be waiting 'til I hear you say I do
Something old something new
Something borrowed something blue
I'll be waiting 'til I hear you say I do
Always better than worse
Protect you from the hurt
I'll be waiting 'til I hear you say I do
I do love you yes I do love you
I'll be waiting 'til I hear you say I do
Cause I love you love you
I'll be by your side 'til the day I die
I'll be waiting 'til I hear you say I do
Something old something new
Something borrowed something blue
I'll be waiting 'til I hear you say I do
We're shining like a diamond just look at us now
I wanna hear you say I do
