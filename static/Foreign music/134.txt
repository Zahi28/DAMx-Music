Just Give Me a Reason
P!NK/Nate Ruess
The Truth About Love (Fan Edition)

P!nk£º
Right from the start
You were a thief you stole my heart
And I your willing victim
I let you see the parts of me
That weren't all that pretty
And with every touch you fixed them
Now you've been talking in your sleep
Oh oh
Things you never say to me
Oh oh
Tell me that you've had enough
Of our love our love
P!nk£º
Just give me a reason
Just a little bit's enough
Just a second we're not broken just bent
And we can learn to love again
It's in the stars
It's been written in the scars on our hearts
We're not broken just bent
And we can learn to love again
Nate Ruess£º
I'm sorry I don't understand where all of this is coming from
I thought that we were fine
P!nk£º
Oh we had everything
Nate Ruess£º
Your head is running wild again
My dear we still have everything
And it's all in your mind
P!nk£º
Yeah but this is happening
Nate Ruess£º
Now you've been having real bad dreams
Oh oh
You used to lie so close to me
Oh oh
Both£º
There's nothing more than empty sheets
Between our love our love
Oh our love our love love
Both£º
Just give me a reason
Just a little bit's enough
Just a second we're not broken just bent
And we can learn to love again
I've never stopped
You're still written in the scars on my heart
You're not broken just bent
And we can learn to love again
P!nk£º
Oh tears ducts and rust
I'll fix it for us
We're collecting dust but our love's enough
Nate Ruess£º
You're holding it in
P!nk£º
You're pouring a drink
Nate Ruess£º
No nothing is as bad as it seems
P!nk£º
We'll come clean
Both£º
Just give me a reason
Just a little bit's enough
Just a second we're not broken just bent
And we can learn to love again
It's in the stars
It's been written in the scars on our hearts
That we're not broken just bent
And we can learn to love again
Just give me a reason
Just a little bit's enough
Just a second we're not broken just bent
And we can learn to love again
It's in the stars
It's been written in the scars on our hearts
We're not broken just bent
And we can learn to love again
P!nk£º
Oh we can learn to love again
Oh we can learn to love again
Oh
That we're not broken just bent
And we can learn to love again
