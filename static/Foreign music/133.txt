Skin Tight (Explicit)
Niykee Heaton
Bad Intentions

I don't make promises no I never say forever
Never in a million did I think we'd be together
Really knocked me off my game my game
Now I guess my mind's been changed changed
I don't even recognize the person in the mirror
Then you come around and make the whole thing clearer
Damn you make me act so bad so bad
I know you can feel me on that
When it comes to you
I break all the rules
Ain't nobody love me like you do
Oh you got me trippin acting a fool
We could do this all night
Way your body fits mine
Ooh your love is skin tight alright
Everybody's watching let them stare
People gonna talk but I don't care
We could do this all night
Way your body fits mine
Ooh your love is skin tight alright
Never have I ever believed in a happy ending
All them fairy tales always knew they were just pretending
Never gonna be like that that
Oops I better take that back back
When it comes to you
When it comes to you
I break all the rules
Ohh
Ain't nobody love me like you do
Oh you got me trippin acting a fool
We could do this all night
Way your body fits mine
Ooh your love is skin tight alright
Everybody's watching let them stare
People gonna talk but I don't care
We could do this all night
Way your body fits mine
Ooh your love is skin tight alright
Your love be like skin tight
Your love be like skin tight
Your love be like skin tight
Your love be like skin tight
Your love be like skin tight
Your love be like skin tight
Your love be like skin tight
Ohh ohh
Never thought I'd be that girl
Then you came rock my world
Never thought I'd be that girl
Then you f**ked up my world
Ain't nobody love me like you do
Oh you got me trippin acting a fool
We could do this all night
Way your body fits mine
Ooh your love is skin tight alright
Everybody's watching let them stare
People gonna talk but I don't care
We could do this all night
Way your body fits mine
Ooh your love is skin tight alright
Your love be like skin tight
Your love be like skin tight
Your love be like skin tight
Your love be like skin tight
Your love be like skin tight
Your love be like skin tight
Your love be like skin tight
