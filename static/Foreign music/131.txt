Dangerous

The way she came into the place I knew right then and there
There was something different about this girl
The way she moved her hair her face her lines
Divinity in motion as she stalked the room
I could feel the aura of her presence
Every head turned feeling passion and lust
The girl was persuasive the girl I could not trust
The girl was bad
The girl was dangerous
I never knew but I was walking the line
Come go with me
I said I have no time
And don't you pretend we didn't talk on the phone
My baby cried she left me standing alone
She's so dangerous
The girl is so dangerous
Take away my money
Throw away my time
You can call me honey
But you're no d**n good for me
She came at me in sections with the eyes of desire
I feel trapped into her web of sin a touch
A kiss a whisper of love
I was at the point of no return
Deep in the darjness of passion's insanity
I felt taken by lust's stranger inhumanity
The girl was persuasive the girl I could not trust
The girl was bad the girl was dangerous
I never knew but I was living in vain
She called my house you said you know my name
And don't you pretend
You never did me before
With tears in her eyes
My baby walked out the door
She's so dangerous
The girl is so dangerous
Take away my money
Throw away my time
You can call me honey
But you're no d**n good for me
Dangerous the girl is so dangerous
I have to pray to God
Cause I know how lust can blind
It's a passion in my soul
But you're no damn lover friend of mine
I cannot sleep alone tonight
My baby left me here tonight
I cannot cope 'til it's all right
You and your manipulation
You hurt my baby
And then it happened
She touch me
For the lips of a stranger woman
Drop as a honey comb
And her mouth was smooth than oil
But her inner spirit as sharp as a two edged sward
But I loved it
Cause it's dangerous
Dangerous the girl is so dangerous
Take away my money
Throw away my time
You can call me honey
But you're no d**n good for me
Dangerous
The girl is so dangerous
Take away my money
Throw away my time
You can call me honey
But you're no d**n good for me
Dangerous
The girl is so dangerous
Take away my money
Throw away my time
You can call me honey
But you're no d**n good for me
Dangerous
The girl is so dangerous
I have to pray to God
'Cause I know how lust can blind
It's a passion in my soul
You're no damn but lover friend of mine
My baby
My baby
