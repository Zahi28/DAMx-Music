You Got Me
Colbie Caillat
Breakthrough

You're stuck on me
And my laughing eyes
I can t pretend
Though I try to hide
I like you
I like you
I think I felt my heart skip a beat
I'm standing here
And I can hardly breathe
You got me Yeah
You got me
The way you take my hand
Is just so sweet
And that crooked smile of yours
It knocks me off my feet
Oh I just can't get enough
I'm a stoup I need to fill me up
It feels so good it must be love
It's everything
That I've been dreaming of
I give up I give in I let go
Let's begin
Cuz no matter what I do
Oh oh
My heart is filled with you
I can't imagine what it'd be like
Livin' each day in this life
Without you Oh
Without you
One look from you
I know you understand
This mess we're in you know
Is just so out of hand
Oh I just can t get enough
I'm a stoup I need to fill me up
It feels so good it must be love
It's everything
That I've been dreaming of
I give up I give in I let go
Let's begin
Cuz no matter what I do
Oh oh
My heart is filled with you
I hope we always feel this way
I know we will
And in my heart I know
You'll always stay
Oh I just can't get enough
I'm a stoup I need to fill me up
It feels so good it must be love
I give up I give in I let go
Let's begin
Cuz no matter what I do
Oh I just can't get enough
I'm a stoup I need to fill me up
It feels so good it must be love
I give up I give in I let go
Let's begin
Cuz no matter what I do
Oh oh
My heart is filled with you
Oh oh
You got me You got me
Oh oh oh oh
You got me You got me
